Privacy Policy for InsulinAdvisor

1. Introduction

At InsulinAdvisor, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle any personal data or information in connection with the InsulinAdvisor app. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices.

2. No Data Collection

InsulinAdvisor does not collect, store, or share any personal data or information about its users. The app does not access or transmit any personal identifiers, contact information, or health data outside of the user’s device.

3. Health Data

InsulinAdvisor may use data from Apple HealthKit on your device to provide personalized insulin recommendations. However, this data is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted, stored, or accessed by us or any third parties. The app solely operates on your device to provide its functionality.

4. Data Security

Since we do not collect or store any user data, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to personal information. All operations involving health data occur solely on your device, under Apple’s privacy and security framework.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app or on our website.

6. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our practices, you can contact us at:

This privacy policy should suffice for an app that does not collect or transmit user data. You can now provide this privacy policy in App Store Connect by hosting it on a simple webpage or including it directly within the app if that option is available.

If you need further adjustments or have any questions, feel free to ask!
